Mike-Mike Reports

What's a Mike-Mike?
-------------------

We report damage using the Modified-Mercali Scale.
We refer to this using the MM abbreviation, which is
voiced on the radio as "Mike-Mike" (the ISO phonetic
pronounciation of the letter M is "Mike").

The purpose of having an agreed scale is so we can meaninfully collect multiple reports
together and get a common picture of the town's status.

We use the `same system`_ used by Santa Clara County Ares Races, so we can report results up
the chain.  (All jurisdictions in the county use the same system.


.. _`same system`: https://www.scc-ares-races.org/MMScale.html

The `official USGS Modified Mercalli scale`_ has 12 levels.
Our county has truncated the table to 8 levels, with anything
past Severe (MM-8) just counted as the same as Severe.

The goal of the scale is to be somewhat objective, reporting observable damage.  Here's the scale
and guidelines for what each level corresponds to:

When reporting Mike-Mike reports over the radio use this format:

    <your call sign> <your zone> <mike-mike number> <your call sign>

For example:

    W6XRL4 Zone 33 Mike-Mike 3 W6XRL4
