What to do
----------

After an earthquake you should follow the standard CERT procedures:
check yourself, your family, your neighbors.

If you have time and are safe: you should make an initial `Mike-Mike damage report`_ to the town:

If you are a ham radio operator:

    If you are the first one on the frequency: congratulations!  You are now net control.  See that section.

    Otherwise make your `Mike-Mike damage report`_ on the net.

    Monitor the net and listen for further instructions.  The NCO will ask for folks who are available
    to help with tasks; you can check in then.  Follow the NCOs instructions.

If you are not a ham operator but can text:

    Send a text to the CERT phone (650 549 5242) with your Mike-Mike report and
    whether you can respond or not.

    To make the SMS monitor's job easier please format your message like this:

    <<Name>>  <<CERT Zone>>  <<Mike-Mike number>> <<Yes/No repond>>  <<Yes/No Ham>> <<Yes/No CERT Sup>>  <<Yes/No Recon>>

    Where:

    * <<Name>>: Your full name

    * <<CERT Zone>>: The zone you live in.  If you don't recall your zone say "Zone Unknown"

    * <<Mike-Mike number>>: Your severity observation.  See the `Mike-Mike damage report`_
      section for the definitions

    * <<Yes/No repond>>: whether or not you can help out: "Yes repond" if you can; "No respond" if you can't

    * <<Yes/No Ham>> whether or not you have a ham license and a working radio you can use

    * <<Yes/No CERT Sup>> whether or not you are a CERT Supervisor

    * <<Yes/No Recon>> whether or not you are Recon trained and willing to do so


    Example:

    Jane Doe Zone 35 MM-4 Yes-Respond No-Ham No-Sup Yes-Recon

    If you can listen to W6LAH: turn on your radio; it will be the fastest way to get updates.

    Once the SMS monitor is up and running you should expect a response with further instructions.
    You may be asked to stand by, or you may be given a task.  Remember: you are a volunteer; you
    should feel free to reject any assignment that you aren't comfortable with.

    If you don't hear back within 30 minutes or so:  you can gather your personal protective equipment and gear,
    and  proceed to the ARK.  
    Remember: silence *may* mean that we aren't activating, or that SMS is not functioning.

    One of the early tasks is to send a ham radio operator to the ARK so we can pass information to
    anyone who is gathered there.

If you can't text:

    You can go to the ARK and await further instructions.

If you are at the ARK:

    A ham radio operator will be dispatched to the ARK if we are activating.

    If no one shows up in 45 minutes: you will have to use your judgement.
    If damage is light or nonexistant then no one arriving with a ham radio probably
    means we aren't activating.  If there is lots of damage then it
    means things are running slowly; eventually someone will show up
    (even if they have to walk or bike).

    But this is yet one more reason who you should have a ham radio,
    even without a license: you can listen to the radio to get status,
    even if you can't legally transmit.
