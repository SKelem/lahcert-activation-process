What to do
----------

After an earthquake you should follow the standard CERT procedures:
check yourself, your family, your neighbors.

If you have time and are safe: you should make an initial damage report to the town.

If you are a ham radio operator:

    If you are the first one on the frequency: congratulations!  You are now net control.  See that section.

    Otherwise make your `Mike-Mike damage report`_ on the net.

    Monitor the net and listen for further instructions.  The NCO will ask for folks who are available
    to help with tasks; you can check in then.  Follow the NCOs instructions.

If you are not a ham operator but can text:

    Send a text to the CERT phone (650 549 5242) with your Mike Mike report and
    whether you can respond or not.

    To make the SMS monitor's job easier please format your message like this:

    <<Name>>  <<CERT Zone>>  <<Mike-Mike number>> <<Yes/No repond>>  <<Yes/No Ham>> <<Yes/No CERT Sup>>  <<Yes/No Recon>>

    Example:

    Jane Doe Zone 35 MM-4 Yes-Respond No-Ham No-Sup Yes-Recon

    If you can listen to W6LAH: turn on your radio; it will be the fastest way to get updates.

    Once the SMS monitor is up and running you should expect a response with further instructions.
    You may be asked to stand by, or you may be given a task.  Remember: you are a volunteer; you
    should feel free to reject any assignment that you aren't comfortable with.

    If you don't hear back within 30 minutes or so.  You can gather your personal protective equipment and gear,
    and  proceed to the ARK.  
    Remember: silence *may* mean that we aren't activating, or that SMS is not functioning.

    One of the early tasks is to send a ham radio operator to the ARK so we can pass information to
    anyone who is gathered there.

If you can't text:

    You can go to the ARK and await further instructions.
