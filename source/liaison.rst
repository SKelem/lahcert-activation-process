========================
County Liaison
========================

Overview
--------

The County Liaison's responsibility is to act as a relay of information between the local town
radio net and the County ARES/RACES Resource net.

Tasks
-----

The Liaison needs to be able to monitor both the local town net and the county resource net
(usually on AA6BT, and eventually W6ASH once the repeaters are linked).
Ideally the Liaison will have radio equipment that can monitor two channels simultaneously,
either by having a "dual receive" radio or two radios.

Initially the Liason needs to report to the county net the current town
damage (Mike-Mike) reports, and relay relevant information from the
county net back to the IC (for example: other jurisiction activations
or general announcments).

If the town decides to activate its volunteers the Liason should communicate
that status to the county Resource Net.

The Liaison should monitor the county net and report back significant events (such as other towns activating).

Once the EOC is opened the Liaison role will transition to the radio operators in the EOC.
