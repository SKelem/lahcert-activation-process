========================
County Liaison
========================

Overview
--------

The County Liaison's responsibility is to act as a relay of information between the local town
radio net and the County ARES/RACES Resource net.

Tasks
-----

The Liaison needs to be able to monitor both the local town net and the county resource net
(usually on AA6BT).
Ideally the liaison will have two radios so they can listen to both channels at once,
and monitor one channel when transmitting on the other.

Initially the Liason needs to report to the county net the current town damage (Mike-Mike) reports.
Once the decision to activate is made that needs to be communicated to the county also.
The Liaison should monitor the county net and report back significant events (such as other towns activating).

Once the EOC is opened the liaison role will transition to the radio operators in the EOC.
