Net Control Operator
========================

Responsibilities
---------------------------------------------

The Net Control Operator (NCO) runs the amateur radio part of the net.  Any licensed operator
can be the NCO; generally the first person on will start as the NCO; they can pass the
responsibility off as other, perhaps more qualified, people come onto the net.

The NCO will announce themselves on the radio (typically the W6LAH repeater, if it is operating;
otherwise on the town's simplex frequency).

They will then gather modified mercali incident reports (see the `Mike-Mike Reports`_ chapter for more information
about this system and how we use it).  The normal expectation is that we will collect mike-mike reports for about 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes the NCO will check the results.  If over 25% of the reports are MM6 or higher then we will start the activation process.

If we are activating the NCO's responsibilities are to:

* Run the net, coordinating transmissions among net participants
* Keep a roster of who is on the net, to communicate to the IC and other folks who need to know.

The NCO will help in the selection of the Incident Commander, based on the roster of checked in people.

After that the NCO will focus on running the net,
and communicating tasks from the IC (and others) and facilitating communication until we can transition
operations to the ARK and EOC.
