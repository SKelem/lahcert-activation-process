========================
SMS Monitor
========================

Overview
--------

The SMS Monitor's job is to read and respond to SMS messages from our CERTs, gathering available
responders and communicating assignments.


Details
-------

Our CERT phone number (650 549 5242) is a Google voice number.  This means it is a virtual number.
Many people can monitor it.

We also have SMS messages set up to forward to a cell phone in the ARK (note: this doesn't exist
in June 2020, but we're working to get a cell phone and this document assumes we have one).

To access text messages during an event: it helps to have set up things before hand.

Here are the ways to access SMS messages in Google Voice:

* You can receive emails with text messages.

  We have google voice configured to send all text messages to the lahcert at gmail account.  You can
  ask to have a forwarding rule set up to forward text messages to your personal email.  This only works
  if the internet is accessable.


* You can log into the lahcert account and view the messages on line at voice.google.com.  Doing this will
  allow you to send and receive messages.  Of course: this assumes the internet is working.


* You can have sms messages forwarded to your phone.  This is what we do for the CERT phone.  This requires
  the cell system to be operating.

As of 2020-06, only Neil Katin and Dave Stewart are set up to do this.  We should get additional volunteers.


Responsibilities
----------------

As SMS Monitor you will need to stay in contact with the IC and NCO and relay messages back and forth.

You should expect the IC to ask for a information about people who have checked in, and receive requests
to relay to those people.
